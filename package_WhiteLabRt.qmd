### Brief description

This package implements methods described in @Li2021Bayesian for backcalculation and nowcasting and @zhou2022estimation for small area estimation using mobility data. The package uses STAN to improve computational efficiency and stability. All methods are implemented in a Bayesian framework. Currently the package does not allow the user to incorporate both mobility data and do nowcasting and account for reporting delays.

### Methods

This package contains the following methods:

@Li2021Bayesian
- Adjustment for reporting delay and nowcasting estimates

@zhou2022estimation
- Mobility data in a hierarchical model to obtain spatially granular estimates.

### Assessment

| | 
|:---|:--------|
|<strong>Features</strong>||
| Ability to nowcast/forecast| Nowcasting, not forecasting |
| Incorporates delay distributions| No, but some functions that calculate a reporting delay distribution from missing line-list data |
| Estimates expected cases| Yes|
| Communicates uncertainty| Yes|
|<strong>Validation</strong>||
| Documentation of package methods| Yes|
| Documentation of package implementation| Yes|
